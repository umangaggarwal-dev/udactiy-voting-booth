1. Proactive not Reactive; Preventative not Remedial
    a. How this application does it -

        As we are designing the application changes keeping data privacy in mind, we are very proactive and considering
        the important edge cases to keep our data safe and the user information private.

    b. What we can do better -

        As we are heavily dependent on the secrets we are keeping, we are still prone to insider attacks. There are
        technologies to keep these secrets safe and private.

2. Privacy as the Default
    a. How this application does it -

        The privacy of the user data is not compromised by default.
        Moreover, we are ensuring data minimization and are clearly stating the use and retention of data.
        We are not sharing the information with anyone.

    b. What we can do better -

        We can offer more information about why we are taking any information, minimization and the privacy settings.

3. Privacy Embedded into Design
    a. How this application does it -

        As we are providing privacy assurance throughout the business/operation of voting we are ensuring privacy into
        the design.

    b. What we can do better -

        Another important aspect of privacy embedded design is infrastructure privacy. Compromised database and secrets
        could have a devastating impact.
        We should also make the entire database immutable.

4. Full Functionality — Postive-Sum, not Zero-Sum
    a. How this application does it -

        The enhancement of privacy does not compromise the operations of the voting system. There are a number of ways
        we are helping both privacy and operations -
        1) The national ID and user information is kept obfuscated/encrypted after a voter registration. We are still
        verifying voter registration by obfuscating the provided national ID and matching it with the database.
        2) The ballot numbers are generated as a non-deterministic hash of the national ID. This way we are able to tell
        whether the ballot belongs to the given national ID or not. However, since the hash is non-deterministic it is
        practically impossible to find out if two ballots belong to the same voter.
        3. Though the votes are cast against the ballot number, we are still preventing double voting. This is done by
        checking the voter's current status, which is updated to 'voted' once the voter casts the vote. When a second
        ballot is used by the voter, it is validated with the national ID and marked as fraud.

    b. What we can do better -

        We could not make the ballot status immutable, as we are updating the status to counted, fraud etc. This puts
        us on the risk of a compromised ballot if someone has the access to the internal implementation or the database.

5. End-to-End Security — Lifecycle Protection
    a. How this application does it -

        We are providing voter-specific ballots and ensuring that only that authorised voter is able to cast the ballot.
        The ballot numbers are generated as a non-deterministic hash of the national ID. This way we are able to tell
        whether the ballot belongs to the given national ID or not. However, since the hash is non-deterministic it is
        practically impossible to find out if two ballots belong to the same voter.

    b. What we can do better -

        We can add multi-factor authentication to further enhance the authentication process.

6. Visibility and Transparency
    a. How this application does it -

        We are providing user the information that we are keeping the national ID only for the verification and the vote
        is anonymous after that.
        We are also sharing the information that we still create an internal list of fraud voters which is not shared
        publicly.

    b. What we can do better -

        We can share information that we do not share information with any third-party.

7. Respect for User Privacy
    a. How this application does it -

        We are providing user an initial prompt, providing the privacy policy information, and then taking their consent
        by clicking on the 'OK' button on the prompt window.
        The users are free to cancel the vote by clicking on the cancel button.
        The users are also prompted once the vote has been cast about how to de-register the vote before the results
        are out.

    b. What we can do better -

        We can provide more information about the user's data retention in case the user wants to de-register the vote.
